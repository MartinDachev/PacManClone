# PacManClone
Pac Man Clone made in C# XNA

Currently work in progress :)

To open the project you should have Visual Studio and XNA Framework installed.
You can start the application without recompiling it by going to the "Debug" folder ("bin\x86\Debug") and starting PacMan.exe 

You should have XNA Framework, DirectX and .NET Framework to run the game.
Keep in mind that if you move, the .exe, you still need the "Content" folder in the same directory where the .exe is. 
"Content" folder is in "Debug" too.
